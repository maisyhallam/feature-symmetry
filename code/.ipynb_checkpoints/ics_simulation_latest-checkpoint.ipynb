    "# Internal co-selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal co-selection refers to the tendency for kinship systems to have cross-generational consistency in the terminological distinctions or mergers that are made. That is, if your parents' elder brothers share a kin term, then so too will their children. Or if your parents' sisters are distinguished from your parents' brothers, so too will their children be distinguished. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a kinship system like so: as in English, you call your parents' brothers are  *uncles*, and their sisters *aunts*. You call the child of your uncle a *chuncle*, and the child of your aunt a *chaunt*. Thus, you make the same sorts of distinctions among your parents' siblings' generation of kin as are made among your own generation of kin - and you can be certain about which children belong to which parents as a result. This is an example of internal co-selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will gather information about the robustness of this tendency cross-linguistically, using data from Kinbank, a global database of kin terminology. We will also create simulations of existing kinship systems to find out whether internal co-selection is more common in kinship systems cross-linguistically (for a given amount of terminological variation) than we would expect by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will measure internal co-selection in terms of the **mutual information** between Generation N and Generation N+1 in a particular kinship system. That tells us how much information can be gained from one generation by observing the other - how certain we can be about which children 'go with' which parents. This can be calculated as the **entropy** of one generation (how much unpredictable variation there is) minus the **conditional entropy** between the two generations (how much unpredictability remains in one generation after observing another).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the mutual information (MI) of a particular kinship system, we must perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract kin terminology data from Kinbank for this language.\n",
    "2. Condense the full kinship system down to the terms we are interested in: Ego's generation and Ego's parents' generation.\n",
    "3. Calculate the probabilities of each kin term within the generation in which it belongs; and the probabilities of each parent-child pair.\n",
    "4. Calculate entropy, conditional entropy, subtract them from each other to get the mutual information of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we get that going, we can do these same calculations on simulated kinship systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extract kin terminology from Kinbank\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's actually load our data in. The following function `get_kb_files()` pulls the full list of Kinbank filenames. Later, we can iterate through these to generate MI values for every language in our dataset."

These simulations give us a baseline with which to compare the MI scores of real languages. Do languages across the world have greater mutual information between two generations than we would expect by chance?\n",

    "If we want to argue that internal co-selection is a product of cultural evolution, we need to dispel the possibility that it occurs by chance.\n",

    "An important aspect of MI that we have not discussed so far: it is dependent on the amount of variation within the kinship system. A system with only one unique term in each generation would have MI of 0, which seems pretty terrible! But given this very limited variation (indeed, no variation), 0 is the highest MI such a language could have. As such, we perhaps need to modify our claim that kinship systems have \"high MI\" to be more specific: kinship systems in the wild have high MI *for the amount of variation in terminology they have*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare real languages to simulations, we need a simulation which maintains the number of terms while randomising which child terms pair with which parent terms. To do this, we will take each language in our data, and randomly scramble which terms go with which types (within generation). This will randomise the syncretisms within the generations while maintaining the same amount of variation across the system overall.\n",

    "To do this, we need to take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract the kinship system of a language from kinbank (check!)\n",
    "2. Filter the two generations we are interested in (check!)\n",
    "3. Randomly reassign the kinship terms to new types.\n",
    "4. Repeat the process a bunch of times for each language.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already have the infrastructure for the first two! `get_kin_terms()`,  `get_pairs()` and `split_pairs()` will do this for us. So let's skip to 3, and write a function that randomises which terms form pairs, assuming that we have already extracted the kinship system and filtered the relevant pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the order of `pairs` is preserved when we run `split_pairs()`. So when we pass `gn` and `gn1` to `shuffle_pairs()`, we know that we can re-unite our pairs by using the same index. Equally, when we shuffle `gn` and `gn1` in place, we know that we can safely combine them to make a new, randomised pair in place of the 'real' Nogai pair."
