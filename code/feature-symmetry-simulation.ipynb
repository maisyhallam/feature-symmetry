There's two lists of pairs for each kind of feature distinction - one for the terms in Generation N and one for the terms in Generation N+1.

At least for now, we're going to remove all the `null`s from the total number of distinctions - otherwise our analysis gets completely skewed by incomplete data. So the function below takes all the non-`null` distinctions, puts them in a list, sums that list and divides that sum by the length of the list. If the length of the list is 0, then we can't get any useful information from this language (there aren't any non-`null` scores). We give it a score of `discard` so we can easily discard it from the analysis later."
